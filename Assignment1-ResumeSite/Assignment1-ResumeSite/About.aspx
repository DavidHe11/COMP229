    <h3>Make Awesome Games Again!</h3>
    <div>
    <h4>Hello, My name is David He. I would like to one day work on/with games.</h4>
    <br />
        <p>I love Games, no matter the genre and would like to able to make them. I am looking for a simple job where I can do my best at releasing games
            at a steady rate because the games industry is constantly innovating and competing. I would like to eventually start my own studio.
        </p>
        <p>I am currently a second year College student at Centennial College. I graduated from highschool in 2012 before going to UTSC for Psychology.
        I had always wanted to be a part of the game/entertainment industry so I made a switch in Fall 2015. I am expected to graduate in Fall 2018.
        I am currently 21 years old, a Canadian born citizen and currently reside in Scarborough ON, I can speak English and Cantonese fluently. <br />
        I enjoy a variety of hobbies, from playing games(video/board/physical) and reading books to sports and music.
